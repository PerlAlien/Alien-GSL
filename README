Alien::GSL 0.01
===============

This module is meant to ease the install of the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL). 
It also provides version checking and build flags via the gsl-config utility.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  File::Chdir
  LWP::Simple
  Archive::Extract (in core after Perl 5.9.5)

This module requires Perl version 5.8.0 but not for any more specific reason than I do not want to test below that version number.
